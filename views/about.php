														This is an app done by a group of students who are currently taking a module CS3213.</br>
														Other than trying to score well, we are also happy to create an app in hope to inspire kids
														to learn programming. By using cute graphics and easy drag and drop interface, we hope to 
														remove the misconception that programming can only be done by typing thousand lines of codes.
														</br></br>
														Thank you for your support.
