    <h2>About us</h2>

    <p>This is an app done by a group of students who are currently taking a
    module CS3213.</p>

    <p>Other than trying to score well, we are also happy to create an app in
    hope to inspire kids to learn programming. By using cute graphics and easy
    drag and drop interface, we hope to remove the misconception that
    programming can only be done by typing thousand lines of codes.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your support.</p>
